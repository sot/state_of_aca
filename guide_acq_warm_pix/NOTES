Scripts
-------

make_warm_pix_estimation_table.py - make some pickle and numpy-save tables to speed up 
calculating and estimated warm pixel count for a given time and temperature

warm_pix.py - include utility to estimate warm pixels count for a given time, temperature, and 
warm pixel threshold

make_acq_table_with_warm_pix.py - grab acq stats from database and add temperature and warm pix 
estimate, save to a numpy save file

make_gui_table_with_warm_pix.py - grab guide stats from database and add temperature and warm 
pix estimate, save to a numpy save file

acq_warm_fit.py - fit scale and offset of warm pixels to acq failures in mag bins

acq_warm_fit_unequal.py - fit scale and offset of warm pixels to acq failures in mag bins 
(spaced to try to sample more where the curve was changing the most)

gui_warm_fit.py - fit scale and offset of warm pixels to guide bad trak in mag bins

gui_warm_fit_unequal.py - fit scale and offset of warm pixels to guide bad trak in mag bins 
(spaced to try to sample more where the curve was changing the most)
